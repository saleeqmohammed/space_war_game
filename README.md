# SPACE WAR ðŸš€
![](dist/space_art-1.png)
"SPACE WAR is my modern reimagining of the classic shoot 'em up (shmup) genre, built with Pygame. Featuring enhanced graphics and immersive sound effects, it delivers an adrenaline-pumping, keyboard-busting experience. This game pays homage to the genre's origins, inspired by Spacewar!â€”one of the earliest computer games, created in 1962."
